# Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Evan James Otilla, but you can call me Evan or EJ.

Music has played a significant role in shaping who I am as a person today. I love discovering new artists and experimenting with different instruments. Listening to music not only inspires my creativity but also influences my design work.

Check out my [favorite playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2e6JDRecVbYUk4PKmZX2XV) to hear some of the artists that inspire me!

#### Fun Fact!

I quoted a song lyric from Jeremy Zucker's song, "full stop," from his album, *love is not dying*, in my high school yearbook:

> "Will the solace in art fill the hole in my heart?" â€” Jeremy Zucker

This quote essentially reflects my values and inspires me to use design to express myself and interact with others. I truly believe that meaningful art can bring comfort and have a positive impact, which motivates me to communicate my ideas clearly in my work.

### Graphic Design

I enjoy creating visually appealing content that effectively conveys ideas. Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator are my go-to tools for making my ideas come to life. I was heavily involved in my high school's multimedia and theatre programs, where I developed numerous projections and posters, as well as photo manipulations.
