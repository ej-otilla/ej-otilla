# Hello, world! üëã

### My name is Evan James Otilla, but you can call me Evan or EJ.
I am a first-year student in the Interactive Design program, majoring in Web Design and Development at SAIT. I enjoy creating digital experiences that connect with people by blending great design with functionality. I use he/him pronouns.

## Creative Outlets üß©

### Music üéß
Music has played a significant role in shaping who I am as a person today. I love discovering new artists, singing, and experimenting with different instruments including the drums, electric and acoustic guitars, and piano. Listening to music not only inspires my creativity but also influences my design work.

#### Fun Fact ‚ö°Ô∏è

I chose a line from Jeremy Zucker's song "full stop," which is from his album *love is not dying*, as my senior quote for my high school yearbook:

> "Will the solace in art fill the hole in my heart?" ‚Äî Jeremy Zucker

This quote deeply resonates with me because it essentially captures how art can be a source of comfort when we are experiencing difficult times. I view design as the chance to articulate emotions and, through them, find a place to connect with people. My hope is that through my work, I can offer a sense of warmth, helping to fill those emotional gaps we all experience.

### Graphic Design üé®

I take pleasure in creating visually appealing content that effectively conveys ideas. Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator are my go-to tools for making these ideas come to life. I was heavily involved in my high school's multimedia and theatre programs, where I developed numerous projections and posters, as well as photo manipulations.

### Video Editing üé¨

I enjoy creating and editing short-form content such as reels, short films, and animations through the use of Adobe Premiere Pro, as it allows me to combine storytelling with visual art and experiment with dynamic editing techniques to effectively engage audiences. I have also attempted to edit long-form content such as gaming videos, but lost interest due to a lack of time.

## Programs üë®‚Äçüíª

I am highly proficient in the following programs:

- Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Lightroom
- Adobe Illustrator, Canva
- Adobe Premiere Pro, CapCut, DaVinci Resolve
