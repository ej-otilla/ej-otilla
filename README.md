## Creative Outlets üß©

### Music üéß
Music has played a significant role in shaping who I am as a person today. I love discovering new artists, singing, and experimenting with different instruments including the drums, electric and acoustic guitars, and piano. Listening to music not only inspires my creativity but also influences my design work.

Check out my [favorite playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2e6JDRecVbYUk4PKmZX2XV?si=aWZINSBATDujUVmjhdfsWw) to hear some of the artists that inspire me!

*This is a drum cover I did for Tame Impala's song "Eventually." It is a rather lengthy song (about 5 minutes), so I reduced the video to show only what was necessary.*

#### Fun Fact ‚ö°Ô∏è

I quoted a song lyric from Jeremy Zucker's song, "full stop," from his album, *love is not dying*, in my high school yearbook:

> "Will the solace in art fill the hole in my heart?" ‚Äî Jeremy Zucker

This quote essentially reflects my values and inspires me to use design to express myself and interact with others. I truly believe that meaningful art can bring comfort and have a positive impact, which motivates me to communicate my ideas clearly in my work.

### Graphic Design üé®

I take pleasure in creating visually appealing content that effectively conveys ideas. Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator are my go-to tools for making these ideas come to life. I was heavily involved in my high school's multimedia and theatre programs, where I developed numerous projections and posters, as well as photo manipulations.

*This is a poster I designed for the one-act play I stage managed from April to May of 2024.*

### Video Editing üé¨

I enjoy creating and editing short-form content such as reels, short films, and animations through the use of Adobe Premiere Pro, as it allows me to combine storytelling with visual art and experiment with dynamic editing techniques to effectively engage audiences. I have also attempted to edit long-form content such as gaming videos, but lost interest due to a lack of time.
