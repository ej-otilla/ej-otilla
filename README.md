### Fun Fact!

I quoted a song lyric from Jeremy Zucker's song "full stop" from his album "love is not dying" in my high school yearbook:

> "Will the solace in art fill the hole in my heart?" â€” Jeremy Zucker

This quote essentially reflects my values and inspires me to use design to express myself and interact with others. I truly believe that meaningful art can bring comfort and have a positive impact, which motivates me to communicate my ideas clearly in my work.
